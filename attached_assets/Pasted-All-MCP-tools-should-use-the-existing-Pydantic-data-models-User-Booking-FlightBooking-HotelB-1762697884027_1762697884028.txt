All MCP tools should use the **existing Pydantic data models** (User, Booking, FlightBooking, HotelBooking, CarBooking, Passenger, Payment, Flight, Hotel, Room, Car, Airport, City, and all input/output models defined). Do **not** redefine these models — just use them for input/output validation.

**Requirements for the tools:**

1. Tools must be **user-friendly** and return human-readable information whenever possible (e.g., include city names with airports, hotel names with rooms).
2. Tools should **generate standardized IDs** for all records:

   * Booking → BKXXXX
   * FlightBooking → FBKXXXX
   * HotelBooking → HBKXXXX
   * CarBooking → CBKXXXX
   * Passenger → PAXXXXX
   * Payment → PMTXXXX
   * Flight → FLXXXX
   * Room → RMXXXX
   * Car → CARXXXX
3. Tools should **append new records** to the corresponding Google Sheet table and maintain all relationships correctly.
4. Use **FastMCP input/output schema validation** for all endpoints.
5. Test each tool with dummy data after creation.

**Define the following MCP tools:**

* `list_cities()` → Returns all cities.
* `list_airports(city_id: str)` → Returns airports in a city with airport and city names.
* `list_flights(origin_code: str, destination_code: str, date: str)` → Returns flights with availability and human-readable origin/destination info.
* `list_hotels(city_id: str)` → Returns hotels in a city with full details.
* `list_rooms(hotel_id: str)` → Returns rooms with availability and hotel info.
* `list_cars(city_id: str)` → Returns available cars with full location info.
* `create_booking(request: CreateBookingRequest)` → Creates a **single master booking** with optional flight, hotel, and car bookings, adds passengers and payment, returns `BookingResponse`.
* `get_booking(booking_id: str)` → Returns full details of a booking, including all sub-bookings, passengers, and payment.
* `cancel_booking(booking_id: str)` → Cancels a booking and associated sub-bookings, refunds payment.
* `update_passenger(passenger_id: str, updates: dict)` → Updates passenger information.
* `test_tools()` → Runs dummy tests for all tools and returns success/failure and outputs.

**Additional instructions:**

* Ensure all tools **enforce relationships** correctly (e.g., FlightBooking is linked to a Booking).
* Use the **streamable HTTP server of FastMCP** for all endpoints.
* Make the tools **easy for a front-end developer** to use (e.g., no confusing IDs without names).
* Run `test_tools()` after defining all tools to ensure everything works end-to-end.
